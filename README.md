## Debian VM on Apple Silicon to use Docker without Desktop

_Step by step how to set up a Debian VM in UTM, enable port forwarding in UTM and in Debian, and forward Docker commands to use Docker like native on your Mac :technologist:_

</header>

## Step 1: Install UTM

Installing [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM) on your Mac is pretty easy. You can download the .dmg file from the [UTM website](https://mac.getutm.app/) or install the app from the App Store. If you download the app from the website, it's free. I first installed UTM from the page for free and later still purchased it from the App Store because I think they are doing a great job, and it's worth supporting them.

## Step 2: Creating the VM

Download a Debian Netinstall ISO - make sure it's the arm64 version. Start the UTM app, click "Create a New Virtual Machine", "Virtualize", "Other". Click "Browse" and pick your downloaded Debian ISO. Continue by selecting the hardware for your VM. I don't know what you are up to with your VM and Docker, but I recommend not going under 2GB of RAM and 20GB of storage. You could, but it can become a tight squeeze fast, even with these settings. For now, we stay with one network interface for our VM. Follow the guided installation of Debian. When it comes to the software selection, we only need the SSH server and standard system utilities.

Finish the installation and reboot.

In my case, the VM is directly starting back into the installation device. So, time to remove it. Right-click on your VM in UTM, click "Edit" and delete the drive with the installation ISO.

## Step 3: Set up network in UTM and VM

To set up SSH, we need some port forwarding from the Mac to the VM. To achieve that, open the edit window for your VM, create a new network device by clicking "New" under Devices. Important: Leave the old one as it isâ€”that's how your VM gets its internet access. Select Network Mode "Emulated VLAN".

<img width="1012" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d87987-3d80-417f-bd45-fe7285e25a6d" />

With that, you should see the Port Forwarding. Add a new rule, select TCP, 22 for the guest port, and 2222 for your host port (you can choose another port if 2222 is not available on your machine). Save settings and boot your VM and log in to it.

## Step 4: Set up network in your VM

When I made my first attempts at the approach we are using here, I couldn't log into the VM, even though everything seemed to be set up correctly. I'll guide you through the setup on your Debian VM so you don't have to figure it out by yourself.

When you type `ip a` in your VM, you'll see something like this:

<img width="868" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffa3c5e2-adc9-418b-9ae4-b8d231c29125" />

There is your loopback address and, more importantly for now, two more network interfaces. In my case, it's `enp0s1` and `enp0s2`. `enp0s1` is up and fine, but `enp0s2` state is DOWN. I won't presume to judge whether it's a bug or a feature, but we need `enp0s2`. So what to do? First, activate `enp0s2` with:

```bash
sudo ip link set enp0s2 up
sudo dhclient enp0s2
```

<img width="912" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8890f158-ce35-49c6-bdbe-60c3f92274ca" />

This is the first time I can log into the new VM with SSH. Type:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 your-vm-username@127.0.0.1
```

And you will see something like this:

<img width="1377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fad234d-00df-434b-ae54-f8e38283e7c7" />

In my case, this worked fine but didn't survive the reboot. Let's fix that next.

Type `sudo crontab -e` (make sure you are doing it with sudo), pick the editor of your choice (pick nano if you have no experience using editors on the command line).

<img width="1377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cae442f-5c54-4b99-a01d-065bd6bfe521" />

Next, you will see the editor window for your cron jobs. Add the line:

```bash
@reboot sudo ip link set enp0s2 up && sudo dhclient enp0s2
```

And save.

With these changes done, you should be able to access your VM after a reboot from your Mac terminal.

## Step 5: Install Docker

There is a really good guide on how to install Docker on [Docker's official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/). Make sure you do the post-installation setup as well, which is explained [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

## Step 6: Add Docker alias to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`

The last step is an easy one. In your `~/.zshrc`, add the line:

```bash
alias docker="ssh docker docker"
```

<img width="1378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14d9b69-88f7-4801-9bdf-e2597e9621aa" />

Now do:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

When you have completed the last step, you can now test your setup with:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

:tada: Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Debian VM on your Mac and made Docker fully operational. Now you can use Docker as if it were natively installed! :rocket: :whale:
